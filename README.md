# "NASA today"
Uses NASA's INSIGHT API to show last know weather on planet Mars
as well as NASA's APOD API to show the picture/video of the day

the project relies heavily on DOM manipulation

# Currently the mars weather function is unavailable because it has been terminated by NASA!!!

Created without any libraries
